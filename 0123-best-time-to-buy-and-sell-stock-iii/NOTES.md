Looked at the solution for the approach after trying for 90 minutes! Redo with DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING!

The solution needs to calculate the time of the first buys and sells and then second buy and second sell over all the price iterations. This will allow to calculate the max profits with each buy and sell.
