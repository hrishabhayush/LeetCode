â€‹// Note that we need to loop through both the lists to make sure that we did not miss any value and hence we introduce the condition that list1 != null and list2 != null. 

We need to create a ListNode for the initial value and we keep on adding the values to create the linked list to that head. Now, if any of the list1 or list2 is left after exhausting one of the lists, we need to add those values to our created linked list.
