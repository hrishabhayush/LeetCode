The first row goes to the last column, the second row goes to the second last column, and so on. Map through indexes and find a pattern. 

Notice, that the row is present in corresponding column but it's in the reverse order. So, we have to take the transpose as the row becomes the column, and the column becomes the row. Then we can easily get the matrix by taking the reverse of each row. â€‹
